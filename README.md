## 2.4 Design

### 2.4.1 Colour
I started the colour design for the site with a deep purple to represent the grapes and wine that are so often paired with cheese. I then used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate a colour pallete based on the deep purple. I particularly liked this set of colours because they are similar to the colour of cheeses and also some other neutral colours. 

I also checked the contrast of the foreground and background colours based on this pallete passed the standards of [WebAIM.](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

### 2.4.2 Logo
I decided upon a very simple logo so customers would know exactly what the site did. It is also a simple design so it can be used with various colors and edited for future marketing if needed.

### 2.4.3 Font family 

Similar to the colour palette and logo I wanted to keep thing simple with the font so that the design wouldn't distract from the content of the site. 

1. Title: Imprima
2. Body: Inter

# 3. Project Sprints

I used an agile approach to this project by following sprints. The sprints were broken down into issues which were logged on the Github project board. [View here](https://github.com/users/angharadcaswell/projects/1/views/1)

As seen in the image below, I used a kanban board to track the progress of my tickets.

## Sprints:
1. Set up Python, database
2. Set up base html/css and create Home app
3. Set up Authorisation for the site
4. Set up Base template
5. Set up home page
6. Create product App and views for filtering and searching. 
7. Create bag app and add CRUD functionality.
8. Build Check out app and Stripe
9. Edit admin panel 
10. Deploy
11. Marketing initative.
